    <p>At Epicodus, we learn with partners and we match up with someone new everyday. I believe pair learning is a great idea and so far I have learned a lot from all my partners. We each have different backgrounds and ways of thinking so it's great to be able to experience how another person thinks when we both approach programming. Below are some projects I have created so far with my partners from the beginning to most recent. You could see how much learning has happened with each project!</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/tienpdx/hello-world"><li>Hello World</li></a>
              <p>This is our very first project done with simple HTML. My partner was Tara and she is awesome.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tienpdx/my-favorite-places"><li>My Favorite Places</li></a>
              <p>On my second day my partner and I created a page about our favorite places! This is done in HTML and simple CSS. Justin was experienced in coding and made a banner and table to make our page look so pretty! I learned a lot on this day because my partner was more experienced than I am.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tienpdx/Photography"><li>Photography</li></a>
              <p>Our third project looks a lot better because we learned a bit deeper into CSS and added more styling skills to our knowledge. Hooray for Rakhat, my partner! She is a beginner like me! Our page was related to photography but we did not get to finish it. But we learned a lot this day!</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tienpdx/vaca"><li>Vacation</li></a>
              <p>On the fourth day, we created a page about our ideal vacation. We learned bootstrap on this day and it was like opening brand new can of CSS goodness. This project contains HTML, CSS, and a Bootstrap css file. Nuala has a great sense of humor! Yay</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tienpdx/wiki"><li>Wikpedia Page Recreation</li></a>
              <p>After learning what Bootstrap was, me and Nuala tried to recreate the wikipedia page. It was difficult but we actually got somewhere! This project contains HTML, CSS, and a Bootstrap css file.</p>
