    <h3>All about Tien!</h3>

    <img src="img/molang.jpeg" alt="picture of tien" id="tienpic">
    <p>My name is Tien Le and I am a student at Epicodus. It has only been a week but I currently love what everything Epicodus has offered so far. I really like the learning style and the practical nature of the whole course. I can see myself growing each and every day and use the knowledge to apply what I learn and build from it. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>

    <h4>Education</h4>

    <p> I graduated from Portland State University after transfering from Portland Community College. I was very much undecided on what I wanted to do as a career so I just majored in a subject I was interested in which was international studies because I love language, culture, and history. After graduating last year in March, I was lost on what I wanted to do because I did not want to take traditional career routes for my major which was working in politics, government, or nonprofit. I felt a bit limited and I was very conscious that my university studies did not prepare me for the workforce. So here I am at Epicodus! "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when oura dfdfdf power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>

    <h4>Experience</h4>

    <p>My educational background is not in technology at all but I plan to pursue a career in tech in the future as a web developer. I haven't had much working experience. I have only had experience working as an administrative assistant and have done data entry for the production department of a manufacturing company.
