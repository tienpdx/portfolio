    <img src="img/molang.jpeg" alt="picture of tien" id="tienpic">
    <p>My name is Tien Le and I am a student at Epicodus. It has only been a week but I currently love what everything Epicodus has offered so far. I really like the learning style and the practical nature of the whole course. I can see myself growing each and every day and use the knowledge to apply what I learn and build from it. This page is about me! Thank you for viewing!</p>

    <h4>Education</h4>

    <p> I graduated from Portland State University after transfering from Portland Community College. I was very much undecided on what I wanted to do as a career so I just majored in a subject I was interested in which was international studies because I love language, culture, and history. After graduating last year in March, I was lost on what I wanted to do because I did not want to take traditional career routes for my major which was working in politics, government, or nonprofit. I felt a bit limited and I was very conscious that my university studies did not prepare me for the workforce. So here I am at Epicodus!</p>

    <h4>Experience</h4>

    <p>My educational background is not in technology at all but I plan to pursue a career in tech in the future as a web developer. I haven't had much working experience. I have only had experience working as an administrative assistant and have done data entry for the production department of a manufacturing company. I have also been working at the family store out in Beaverton. Come visit us on 185th and Walker Road!"</p>
